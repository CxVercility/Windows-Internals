# Advanced Exploit Mitigation
KIT Windows Internals Proseminar (1,3)

*Abstract*:

In the past years, the amount of attacks on digital systems has increased steadily. We take a look at general techniques used by attackers to compromise Windows systems and some fundamental defense mechanisms against them. This paper will provide an overview of Microsoftâ€™s latest additions to the security concept of the Windows operating system (OS), analyze inherent flaws in their design and take a brief look at already existing attacks.
